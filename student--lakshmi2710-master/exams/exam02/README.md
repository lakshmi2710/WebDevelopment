* Add any files necessary to create the application below
* add, commit, and push the branch to github
* Create a PR to merge to master
* Be sure to include the reviewer(s)
* Due by 11:59pm (PT) Sun Mar 29

## Goal and Requirements

* Did you remember the above requirement about `questions.md`?

You will create a recipe storage and search website, along with the services necessary to support it.

The application will be a single-page application. (which means only one page load!)  It will NOT use React and it will not use Create React App.

I will be able to install, build, and run your application with `npm install`, `npm start`
* You will have to create the necessary `scripts` section in `package.json`
* Hint: It is good to test that this works!

From the main screen when a user loads the application:
* There is an option to login, but they are not required to login to view
* They can see a list of all recipe titles and their authors
* They can click a recipe title to see the recipe (author, title, ingredients, and instructions)
  * Do NOT use the recipe title as an identifier for the record, store an id with each recipe
* Logged in users can add a new recipe (title, ingredients, and instructions)
    * Hint: `<textarea>` is better for long blocks of text than `<input>`
    * Hint: The server must enforce that they are logged in 
* When not on the main page, they can click something to return to the main page

* You must use 'express' as your node server library
* All services will be RESTful
* All services will return JSON data, not HTML
* All services must accept data as query params, in the path of the url, or as JSON data in the body
* You must use 'webpack' and 'babel-loader' to bundle the front end javascript (which must be at least two files)

### Home
* Displays a list of all stored recipes
* Offers the option to login or logout
  * this CAN be present on all pages, but MUST be present on the Home page
* Clicking on a recipe title will load a details page/screen
  * Hint: Remember to preventDefault on links
  * Hint: Remember to SHOW the title for any link, but not to use it as the link parameter
* Clicking on the "New Recipe" button will to the New Recipe page/screen
  * This option is only shown for logged in users
* If a logged in user manually reloads the page, the page should show them as logged in
  * This should be done via a service call result, NOT by checking `document.cookies`

### Login
* They must provide a username to login
* No password
* username "dog" is treated as a bad login
* Show useful error messages if a login is denied

### Logout 
* They will see the Home screen after logging out
* Another user can log in afterwards without requiring a new page load

### Recipe Details
* Displays the author, title, ingredients list, and instructions for the selected recipe
* You can click a "Return to Home" link to return to the Home Page

### New Recipe
* Displays a form to enter the title, ingredients list, and instructions for a new recipe
* The ingredients list is a single textarea field to enter the data
* The instructions list a single textarea field to enter the data
* The user is not allowed to enter a recipe without something present in all 3 fields
* The user can click a "Return to Home" link to return to the Home Page
* The user is put on the Recipe Details screen for the new recipe after successfully submitting a recipe.

### REST Services

* You will need to add REST services to fulfill the needs of the application
* Pick services data, methods, URLs, and status codes to match the requirements of RESTful services as described in class
* Any request/response bodies will be in JSON (if they are present)
* Store the author (username) of a new recipe, along with any created id for that recipe

### Persistence
* There is no particular persistence requirement: the data need only persist as long as the server is running
* If you restart the server, the data is lost
* You may pre-populate some recipes if you wish

## Allowances
* You may create your HTML as you see fit, but it must be fundamentally semantically valid and other best practices from class
* You may create the CSS as you see fit but you must follow the best practices given in class
* You may add icons and background images but there is no requirement to do so
* You may use `express`, `cookie-parser`, and any other modules that have been used in class

## Restrictions
* You must provide meaningful, and where applicable, ACTIONABLE error messages for your user on the page (for service calls)
* You should use no external libraries of any kind save for those explicitly allowed
* Do not use React
* Your JS, HTML, and CSS files must uphold the best practices from class (some, but not all, are listed below)
* You may not use floats to do more than manage flowing text with images
* You may not use HTML tables or CSS table layouts
* Do not have any files in your PR except for the exam (no files from other assignments, for example)
* Do not use var
* Do not use alert
* Do not use terrible variable names
* Do not have console.log debugging messages or commented out code
* The only permitted client-side storage is a single cookie to track login
* Do not use window.location or other redirects
* You may not use CSS preprocessors, minifiers, or other tools to modify your CSS
* There should only be a single page load
